 # Introduction
Finding the right recipe online can be a hassle, especially when most available recipes are for high-end meals that may not be feasible in a middle-class to lower-class home or restaurant. Our application aims to solve this problem by providing a platform where users can find and share simple recipes.

 # Problem Statement
Most online recipe platforms focus on high-end meals, making it difficult for users from middle-class or lower-class backgrounds to find feasible recipes. This creates a need for an application that offers simple and accessible recipes.

 # Solution
Our application allows users to find and share simple recipes online. Each recipe includes ingredients, procedures, and the number of people served. Registered users can also comment, bookmark, and rate recipes.

 # Future Considerations
Convert the application into an Android app.
Allow users to follow each other and receive notifications when users they follow post new recipes.
